## Installation
1. Clone git hub repo. 
2. Install Nodejs. 
3. Install inquirer in to the file using the integrated terminal.
  
## Usage
Using the terminal command `node index.js`, users will be able to create a readme using nodejs. The readme will include the project Title, Description, Uses, Installation, Contributions, Tests, Contact Info, and Sources. The readme will be formatted to meet qualifications of most quality readme files. The readme will be created in a log.md file and each time the user uses the node command, the new informatinon will be appended to the end of that file. I decided to append the file just in case the user did not want to override with each new command.
